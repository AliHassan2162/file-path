            The iconic bagsman, 39, had made his name at Man Utd in the early stages of his career after he joined the
            club from Sporting Lisbon in 2003 as a teenager.

            And his connection with the Manchester outfit grew strong as he made nearly 346 appearances across two
            stints with the Red Devils.

            Now Ronaldo has confessed that he still loves his former club despite being on the books at Saudi Pro league
            side Al-Nassr.

            Speaking in an interview with former Man Utd teammate Rio Ferdinand, Ronaldo claimed "We cannot control
            things at some point on our life sometimes, but itâ€™s done and already done.</p>
